v2.18 Intel Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library Release Notes
==================================================================

RELEASE NOTE CONTENTS
1. KNOWN ISSUES
2. FIXED ISSUES
3. CHANGE LOG & FEATURES ADDED

1. KNOWN ISSUES
----------------

* Perf tests do not run in Windows environment.

* 32-bit lib is not supported in Windows.

2. FIXED ISSUES
---------------

v2.18

* Mac OS X/darwin systems no longer require the --target=darwin config option.
  The autoconf canonical build should detect.

v2.17

* Fix igzip using 32K window and a shared object

* Fix igzip undefined instruction error on Nehalem.

* Fixed issue in crc performance tests where OS optimizations turned cold cache
  tests into warm tests.

v2.15

* Fix for windows register save in gf_6vect_mad_avx2.asm.  Only affects windows
  versions of ec_encode_data_update() running with AVX2.  A GP register was not
  properly restored resulting in corruption on return.

v2.14

* Building in unit directories is no longer supported removing the issue of
  leftover object files causing the top-level make build to fail.

v2.10

* Fix for windows register save overlap in gf_{3-6}vect_dot_prod_sse.asm. Only
  affects windows versions of erasure code.  GP register saves/restore were
  pushed to same stack area as XMM.

3. CHANGE LOG & FEATURES ADDED 
------------------------------

v2.18

* New 2-pass fully-dynamic deflate compression (level -1).  ISA-L fast deflate
  now has two levels.  Level 0 (default) is the same as previous generations.
  Setting to level 1 will switch to the fully-dynamic compression that will
  typically reach higher compression ratios.

* RAID AVX512 functions.

v2.17

* New fast decompression (inflate)

* Compression improvements (deflate)
  - Speed and compression ratio improvements.
  - Fast custom Huffman code generation.
  - New features:
    * Run-time option of gzip crc calculation and headers/trailer.
    * Choice of static header (BTYPE 01) blocks.
    * LARGE_WINDOW, 32K history, now default.
    * Stateless full flush mode.

* CRC64
  - Six new 64-bit polynomials supported. Normal and reflected versions of ECMA,
    ISO and Jones polynomials.

v2.16

* Units added: crc, raid, igzip (deflate compression).

v2.15

* Erasure code updates. New AVX512 versions.

* Nasm support.  ISA-L ported to build with nasm or yasm assembler.

* Windows DLL support.  Windows builds DLL by default.

v2.14

* Autoconf and autotools build allows easier porting to additional systems.
  Previous make system still available to embedded users with Makefile.unx.

* Includes update for building on Mac OS X/darwin systems. Add --target=darwin
  to ./configure step.

v2.13

* Erasure code improvments
  - 32-bit port of optimized gf_vect_dot_prod() functions.  This makes
    ec_encode_data() functions much faster on 32-bit processors.
  - Avoton performance improvements.  Performance on Avoton for
    gf_vect_dot_prod() and ec_encode_data() can improve by as much as 20%.

v2.11

* Incremental erasure code.  New functions added to erasure code to handle
  single source update of code blocks.  The function ec_encode_data_update()
  works with parameters similar to ec_encode_data() but are called incrementally
  with each source block.  These versions are useful when source blocks are not
  all available at once.

v2.10

* Erasure code updates
  - New AVX and AVX2 support functions.
  - Changes min len requirement on gf_vect_dot_prod() to 32 from 16.
  - Tests include both source and parity recovery with ec_encode_data().
  - New encoding examples with Vandermonde or Cauchy matrix.

v2.8

* First open release of erasure code unit that is part of ISA-L.
